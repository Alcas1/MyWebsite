      Over the Summer, I had to purchase a TI-84 Calculator for 8th grade math.
      In the Beginning I had no idea how to use the keys, but eventually after
      toying around with it, I learned the different functions and began to
      code for the first time. I began with simple functions that displayed
      things on the screen. Eventually I began to test with loops and making
      the program travel to different parts in the code. I also wanted to make
      a Role Playing Game based off another game I played called Sonny. The
      game had a great story and a fun and interesting gameplay. It was turn
      based where the player used different moves to fight enemies. It was a
      stat building game where leveling up would allow the building into
      different skill trees. My initial attempt at creating this game did not
      even have different enemies because I could not make the game navigate
      to different parts based on a condition. So I gave up on the game initially.
      I continued testing different functions. When I found out about the if
      and else statements and their uses I knew I could implement it into my game.
      So after I discovered this functionality the progress made on the game
      increased dramatically. I continued working and added more and more features.
