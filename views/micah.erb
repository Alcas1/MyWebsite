      &emsp;In my search of Internships for computer science, I stumbled through many places.
      I sent emails to be usually met with rejections because not many places hired
      kids from high school. Nevertheless, I kept google searching for hours until I
      arrived at a site called 8th light. They seemed software oriented and also offered an
      an apprenticeship program that was a great opportunity. After completing their challenge
      I got interviewed by Micah who determined whether I could work at 8th light or not.
      After the interview, it was him who let me have the experience of working at 8th light
      and I will always remember it.
