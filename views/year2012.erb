    	I took Intro to Computer Science where I learned java and the basics. Grasping
    	OOP was more difficult that I had imagined because I did not know what it was 
    	and I was so used to TI-Basic. Using Objects and functions was much different 
    	than TI-Basic to just go wherever I wanted in the code. Once I understood how
    	I could get wherever I wanted to, it was much easier. During Junior year I was
    	searching for internships through google and multiple other sites. Strings
    	of emails led to no avail. No one wanted a highschool student to work 
    	for them. Eventually after 5 months, I found a company called 8th light. They 
    	wanted me to create a TicTacToe program that never loses and takes wins when
    	it can. After I conceptualized it on paper, I began to slowly code it. For the 
    	next month, I coded it slowly and slowly. After it was done, I had many bugs. I
    	added a display of the turns to the gui so it was easier to track. Testing and
    	fixing bugs became the time spent on the code. I had different people test it
    	and slowly I discovered the bugs in my code that ranged from it taking a space
    	that had already been taken to just not moving on its turn. Through use of the
    	the debugger to determine where the code messed up, I was able to squash the 
    	bugs of my code. I tested and tested until I knew it worked to perfection. I
    	then submitted it to 8th light. It was from there submitted to a craftsman and 
    	then reviewed. The next day, I got an email from that craftsman saying it worked
    	and I needed to plan a phone interview.
