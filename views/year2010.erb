      I continued to work on Gage throughout Freshman year and I updated it constantly
      making new versions while adding new features. I thought I was finished until
      I found out about the getkey functionality. This added alot to the game and I 
      implemented it as well as I could. There was many versions released after this 
      making the game better. After I had run out of memory on the game due to its size,
      I implemented as many memory saving techniques as I could. Some of these included
      making the names of lists shorter, putting more words in a line, and draw graphics 
      with functions instead of saving them in image files. I was able to cut the file
      size in half and with this extra memory I was able to add more functions and make
      more stages and enemies. 5.4 was the official release and I was satisfied with
      the end product.
