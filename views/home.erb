      <Strong>What:</Strong> This is a page I developed on my own with ruby, and sinatra as the framework.
      I made this page during my apprenticeship at 8th light. Feel free to explore
      the site and the projects that I have pursued. If you want to get a hold of me,
      just send me an email through the contact me page leaving your name and email.

     I enjoy coding during my free time, especially in Java. I have also coded in ruby and
     which is the language used on this website including html. I love automating things and
      thinking of different ways that things can be automated. Through this I build ideas for
      programs and utilities.

      I am a huge fan of dubstep and electronic music. I listen to it when I have
      the time. And as for those that have requested me to put up my playlist,
      just navigate to music and you should find all the music that I enjoy.
