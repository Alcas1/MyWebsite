    	Because Math Class started using functions that required alot more functions,
    	it gave me the idea to make programs to automate them and also to double check 
    	the operations. My first program was a prime factorization program. Nearly all
    	the operations at the beginning of the year involved prime factoring, so I
    	created one for the calculator. I used a list that had a changing list number
    	to keep track of the place of the prime factors. The program helped me make 
    	sure I always had the right prime factors. The next program I made was for 
    	synthetic division. The operations for synthetic division were long and tedious.
    	However, the part that really irked me was the repetitiveness. The same 
    	operations were executed again and again so I came to the conclusion that I 
    	wanted to automate it. This program took quote along time to figure out the 
    	concepts for the TI-84. I used a similar technique that I used in my Prime
    	Factorization program. The program became incredibly useful as some the 
    	repetitive tasks became much shorter and I could accomplish more in the 
    	same amount of time.
