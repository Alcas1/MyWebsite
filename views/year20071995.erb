      In 6th grade I was always interested in programming and how different
      applications worked. I was also interested in building legos from a very young age.
      Every little task that I performed alot I wanted a way to repeat functions repeatedly
      with little human input. This led me to the Lego Kit called the RCX or a kit that had
      motors, and a programmable brain. The brain was then allowed to be controlled through
      the use of a program on the computer that was provided with the kit. I could give the
      motors commands and tell the robot what to do using loops and turn commands. It was an
      amazing experience which made me ponder about 2 things: The model robot to use the code
      and the code to use the model robot. The RCX kit let me use logic to program a robot
      that could automate functions. It was what I had imagined.
