      7th grade was the grade I found out about the NXT
      robotics kit. It was a newer and nicer version of the previous RCX
      and was packed with new engines and ways to function.
      It was able to use a different set of motors and could perform the same tasks and
      with much more power and precision. The different functionality of the parts
      made them significantly harder to learn, but I could still make some pretty
      interesting things after going through the tutorials. I had a giant claw that
      picked up soda and moved it and a different robot that push things to different places
      and could be programmed to clean things. It was very innovative and a great chance for me
      to test the extent of my knowledge.
