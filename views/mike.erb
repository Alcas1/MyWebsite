      &emsp;One of my mentors at 8th light. He taught me ruby and guided me through
      as I learned the ways of agile software development. After going through and
      showing me the 3 principles of Test Driven Development(TDD), He demonstrated
      them to me, through katas and then had me perform them. He looked through my
      code and showed me ways to modularize it. I learned so much from him as a
      fellow apprentice and he helped write cleaner code.
